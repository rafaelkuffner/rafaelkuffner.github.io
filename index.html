<h1 name="aboutme">About me</h1>
<div align="right "><a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2616-7541"" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/orcid.png" style="height:20px;" /></a></div>
<p>Hi! I'm Rafael. I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt" target="blank">T&eacute;cnico Lisboa </a>&nbsp;
(where i also took my BsC and MsC in&nbsp;Information Systems and Computer&nbsp;Science).&nbsp;There, I&nbsp;work with the
<a href="http://vimmi.inesc-id.pt/" target="_blank">Visualization and Intelligent Multimodal Interfaces Group at INESC-ID Lisbon</a>. 
However, my main research position is working in the<a href="http://blackbox.fcsh.unl.pt" target="blank"> Blackbox Project at FCSH </a>, where my PhD research
(and more) is being applied to dance and performing arts scenarios. Current interest&nbsp;topics are&nbsp;video-based rendering,&nbsp;point cloud&nbsp;processing/rendering 
and recently also&nbsp;VR and AR.</p>
<p>For more details about who I am, what&nbsp;I like, and&nbsp;what I do,&nbsp; 	I'd encourage clicking the social networks referenced near my portrait.
They will do a better job than some words up here.&nbsp; For anything else, you can send me a nice e-mail which will be replied as soon as I hit F5 on 
gmail waiting for those Journal paper&nbsp;reviews.</p>
